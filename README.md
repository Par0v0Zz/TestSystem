User stories:
 - As a Teacher I want to create new tests and add answers, so that I can test everyone's knowledge;
 - As a Student I want to be able to access and complete tests, so that I will be graded;
 - As a Student I want to see all tests that I've completed and see results, so that I will be informed about my progress;
